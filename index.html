<h1>Twitter Chrome Project (temporary name)</h1>
<p>This is the update page for this project, I will be putting my thoughts and progress on this page pretty commonly, as I work on the project</p>
<p>The project is a way to visualize two different twitter user's overall popularity when compared to each other. Based on each users popularity, they will</p>
<p>be put versus each other on a sort of autobattler game field, something like the relevant autochess trope in modern video games (where pieces have their own gimmicks and fight automatically)</p>
<p>No promises on what kind of game it will be, but the strength of one team will be proportional to their twitter popularity. That is the main idea, essentially a cool looking graph that can be kind of funny</p>

<p>I set up the gitup page for the project, I have worked a little bit during the summer, most of it was working to get p5 and p5.play working on a chrome extension.</p>
<p>After managing to get that working, I spent time on trying to get used to javascript, html, and how chrome extensions work. Honestly, its been pretty tough for me to</p>
<p>keep motivated working on this because chrome extensions make this a pain in the ass to work on for me, despite this i still think the final product will be a cool way to visualize twitter accounts metrics</p>
<p></p>
<p>At this moment I have spent most of my time researching ways i can take in data from twitter. at first I wanted to utilize the twitter api, but I found out that i was spending a lot of time trying to figure out</p>
<p>how to go about it. Normally i would have still continued with it, but then Elon Musk bought twitter and started doing crazy things with the platform, including api changes (the same api I was going to use)</p>
<p>Because of that, I decided to ditch the API route, and instead just have a javascript file that would just parse through the user's current tab and copy the relevant metrics I would need (followers, likes, etc)</p>
<p>Currently I do not have that working, but once I do, I will be able to apply that knowledge to other metrics and finally have data to work with, then I can work on the actual data visualiztion.</p>
<p>I am very excited to see how capable I am with how far I can take this!</p>
